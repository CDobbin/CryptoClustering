# CryptoClustering

This repository contains the solution for the CryptoClustering assignment, which applies unsupervised machine learning to analyze cryptocurrency market data. The project uses Python with libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and hvPlot to cluster cryptocurrencies based on price change percentages over various time periods. The primary goal is to predict whether cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using K-Means clustering, both with original scaled data and data reduced via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The analysis includes elbow curves to determine the optimal number of clusters and scatter plots to visualize the results.

The repository includes the main Jupyter notebook, Crypto_Clustering.ipynb, which contains all the code, visualizations, and answers to the assignment questions. The dataset, crypto_market_data.csv, provides the price change percentages for various cryptocurrencies. Key steps in the notebook include data preprocessing with StandardScaler, finding the best k value using the elbow method, clustering with K-Means, and optimizing clusters with PCA. Composite plots compare the elbow curves and clusters between the original and PCA-transformed data, highlighting the impact of dimensionality reduction.
